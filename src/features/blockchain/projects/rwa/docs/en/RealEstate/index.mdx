# Tokenizing Real Estate Assets

The RWA Platform enables the tokenization of various real estate assets, transforming traditionally illiquid investments into fractional, tradable digital tokens. This unlocks new opportunities for both property owners and investors.

## Example: Tokenizing a Commercial Property

<CodeBlock
  language="json"
  title="Sample Token Configuration (Conceptual)"
  code={`{
  "assetType": "Commercial Real Estate",
  "propertyAddress": "123 Main St, Anytown, USA",
  "valuationUSD": 5000000,
  "tokenSymbol": "PROP123",
  "totalTokens": 500000,
  "pricePerTokenUSD": 10,
  "expectedYieldPerTokenAnnual": 0.60, // Example: 6% annual yield
  "lockupPeriodMonths": 12,
  "legalStructure": "SPV - Prop123 LLC"
}`}
/>

This example illustrates the key parameters you might define when tokenizing a commercial real estate asset on our platform.
