# Introduction to Loyahub

Welcome to Loyahub documentation. This comprehensive guide will help you understand the core concepts and get started with development on our platform.

## Quick Installation

Get started with Loyahub by installing our package:

<TerminalCommands
  title="Installation Steps"
  commands={[
    { 
      command: "npm install loyahub", 
      description: "Install the Loyahub package" 
    },
    { 
      command: "npm run dev", 
      description: "Start the development server" 
    }
  ]}
/>

## Core Concepts

Loyahub is built on several key concepts that you should understand before diving in:

### Smart Contract Integration

<CodeBlock
  language="solidity"
  title="Basic Smart Contract Example"
  code={`
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract LoyaltyProgram {
    mapping(address => uint256) public points;
    
    function awardPoints(address user, uint256 amount) external {
        points[user] += amount;
    }
    
    function usePoints(uint256 amount) external {
        require(points[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient points");
        points[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }
}
`}
/>

### API Integration

Here's how to interact with our API:

<ApiExample
  endpoint="/api/v1/loyalty/points"
  method="POST"
  request={{
    headers: {
      "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN",
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    body: {
      "userId": "123",
      "points": 100,
      "action": "award"
    }
  }}
  response={{
    status: 200,
    body: {
      "success": true,
      "newBalance": 250,
      "transaction": {
        "id": "tx_123",
        "timestamp": "2024-03-21T10:30:00Z"
      }
    }
  }}
/>
